# Stock Dashboard

Disclaimer:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project was created as part of the portfolio project for CS361 - Software Engineering I. This project was in collaboration with another student. The other student created the Assignment8server.js file which is the microservice that my main project interacts with to get stock ticker information. Their microservice sends a csv files of ticker symbols for my main project to parse. 

Project Overview:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Stock Dashboard application allows the user to select a Stock from NASDAQ and retrieve pertinent information. The information contains the price, news, and other information a normal user would use to decide on whether or not they would want to invest in a stock. This project utilizes the Streamlit framework to allow easy displaying of information.
